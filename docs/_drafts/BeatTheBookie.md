I stumbled across [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02824) where a [strategy is explained](https://www.lisandrokaunitz.com/index.php/en/beat-the-bookies-strategy-explained/) and executed to come to the conclusion that [it might not be worth](http://www.lisandrokaunitz.com/index.php/what-does-it-take-to-beat-the-bookies-and-is-it-worth-it/) to beat the bookies.

They have a [dashboard](http://35.185.212.121/) with their advantageous bets and [code](https://github.com/Lisandro79/BeatTheBookie) to reproduce their strategy.
