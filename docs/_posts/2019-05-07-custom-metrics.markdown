If we want to understand our improve neural networks, we will need a metric to check the performance of our models.
In [this notebook](https://github.com/Gearlux/football-predictor/blob/master/03_custom_metrics.ipynb), 
I will implement a metric that measures the profit and margin of our network during the training phase. In order to do this, we also have to implement our own loss function based on categorical_crossentropy.

Have fun exploring !
