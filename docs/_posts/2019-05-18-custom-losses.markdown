While experimenting with a [custom loss function](https://github.com/Gearlux/football-predictor/blob/master/custom loss function.ipynb), I could not generate more profit than with a general classification model. I searched the web and stumbled upon [Machine Learning for Sports betting: not a basic classification problem](https://medium.com/@media_73863/machine-learning-for-sports-betting-not-a-basic-classification-problem-b42ae4900782), [Beating the bookies with machine learning](https://medium.com/vantageai/beating-the-bookies-with-machine-learning-7b429a0b5980) and [Understanding negative log loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-negative-log-loss-8c3e77fafb79).

In a [second notebook](https://github.com/Gearlux/football-predictor/blob/master/more loss functions.ipynb)), 
I found a configuration which seems to generate some profit. Apparently, `deep` learning means adding more layers.
But you also need more data and computing power :-(.

Knowing this, I will try to improve the model by hyperparameter optimization.
