# About me

I am Gert Behiels, a senior researcher in medical image processing who has recently switched to video processing to improve the workflow for X-ray image acquisition.

Although I have a challenging job, I am currently looking for new challences and move from an industry which has become too [regulated](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en) and too [protected](https://eugdpr.org) to [innovate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOYbuK2gOew).
