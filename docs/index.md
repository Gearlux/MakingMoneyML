# Making Money with Machine Learning

> __Friend__: I want to quit my job. I am going to be a data scientist to earn money !

> __Me__: Really ? Being a good data scientist is difficult.

> __Friend__: No, everybody with huge glasses can be a data scientist.

> __Me__: I have huge glasses, and I am telling you being a *good* data scientist is difficult.

> __Friend__: I have found a [site with a bet model](https://www.kaggle.com/sashchernuh/hitting-the-jackpot-tuned-x6) to earn almost 20 times my investment in 5 years.

> __Me__: And the bookmakers are not bankrupt yet ? Here's 10$, remember to pay me 200$ or buy me an expensive dinner within 5 years.

> __Friend__: Within 5 years, I am going to be a millionaire.

> __Me__: Let's take the 10$ and buy me a beer. I will try to explain it with my [Reports](blog.html).
